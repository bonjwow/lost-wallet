## About The Project

This paper is the reproduction of the earlier research paper, *Civic honesty around the globe*, written by Alain
Cohn, Michel André Maréchal, David Tannenbaum, and Christian Lukas Zünd. The purpose of this reproduction work is to identify potential limitations and hidden biases from the original dataset and experimental design of the research paper, and suggest ways to extend and/or improve the original research paper.
